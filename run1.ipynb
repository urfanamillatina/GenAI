      "\n",
      "Answer: Indonesia doesn't have one single officially declared \"national dish\" in the same way some countries do. However, there are several dishes that are widely considered iconic and representative of Indonesian cuisine, and are often referred to as national dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly cited ones are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Nasi Goreng:** This is a very popular fried rice dish, often served with a fried egg, chicken, or shrimp crackers (krupuk). It's incredibly ubiquitous, eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner across the country.\n",
      "2.  **Rendang:** A rich, slow-cooked, and spicy dry curry dish originating from the Minangkabau region of West Sumatra. It's usually made with beef, cooked in coconut milk and a paste of ground spices until the liquid evaporates and the meat caramelizes. Rendang has even been recognized as one of the world's most delicious foods.\n",
      "3.  **Satay:** Grilled skewers of meat (chicken, beef, lamb, etc.) served with a delicious peanut sauce. It's a hugely popular street food and found everywhere.\n",
      "4.  **Gado-Gado:** A vegetable salad made with blanched or steamed vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, boiled potato, fried tofu and tempeh, and lontong (rice cakes), all drizzled with a rich, savory peanut sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "While **Nasi Goreng** and **Rendang** are perhaps the two most frequently mentioned, all four are strong contenders and truly represent the diverse and flavorful culinary landscape of Indonesia.\n",
